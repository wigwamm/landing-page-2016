    <h1>The Unmortgage</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top:35px;font-size:20px;">We're launching an alternative to mortgages, to rescue people from the rent trap (they'd like to own, can afford to own, but the bank's computer says no).<br><br>
      We do this by co-owning with them (they pay rent on the portion they don't own, and can buy back shares in their home at will. Or not, if they choose to).<br><br>
      Our moto is: We believe if you can afford your rent, you can afford to own.</h2>
