    <h1>Youâ€™ve taken the first step to home ownership</h1>
    <p class="uk-text-large">We're launching an alternative to mortgages, to rescue people from the rent trap (they'd like to own, can afford to own, but the bank's computer says no). We do this by co-owning with them (they pay rent on the portion they don't own, and can buy back shares in their home at will. Or not, if they choose to). We believe if you can afford your rent, you can afford to own.</p>
